    * The purpose of HDMI pending is to have a way to set HDMI on/off
    * in setHDMIStatus() and when client calls eventNotification
    * it is using getHDMIStatus() and pass it to eventNotification.
    *
    * So code path works like that:
    * client calls setHDMIStatus(true) - hdmi is pending
    * client calls eventNotification(getHDMIStatus(), fmt)
    * getHDMIStatus will give true and that is passed to
    * eventNotification and only then we will move
    * hdmi state to be ON.
    *
    * All of that code be avoided if hwc/framebuffer.cpp won't
    * have crazy sync issues.
    *
    * setHDMIStatus is being called from HWC with hdmi on/off arg.
    * We retrieve the ov state in order to manipulate it based on
    * the hdmi state (on/off).
    * In the case where our currnt HDMI is on (hdmi is connected)
    * or HDMI is pending (which means setHDMIStatus(true) was called
    * and we set pending to HDMI_ON so who ever calls getHDMIStatus()
    * will get HDMI_ON).
    *
    * In case of setHDMIStatus(false) we would like to quickly
    * response to it before eventNotification is being called.
    * That is because suspend will call setHDMIStatus(false)
    * but won't call eventNotification.
    *
    * In that case we just clear the bits of EXT/UI
    * and call handleevent with the new state.
    * if fmt is DISPLAY_FMT_NONE, we just send CLOSED.
    *
    * FIXME - we cannot react the same wai when setHDMIStatus(true)
    * comes in because we do not have the fmt of the buffers here.
    * but we still could just set EXT bit on and call the overlay.
    * */

   /*
    * You can call eventNotification with the state directly.
    * hdmi/fmt set accordingly when it's closed event.
